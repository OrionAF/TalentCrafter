# TalentCrafter
TalentCrafter is a compact talent guide viewer and calculator for Turtle WoW (1.12.1).

# Highlights

- **No hardcoded talents:** Trees, talents, ranks, and icons are read directly from the game client API for your class. If Turtle WoW adjusts a tree, TalentCrafter reflects it automatically.
- **Familiar layout:** The calculator mirrors all three of your class's in-game talent trees for quick recognition.
- **Plan ahead:** Map your picks level-by-level in the calculator; the viewer shows exactly what to take as you level.

# Compatibility

Designed for **Turtle WoW** on the **1.12.1** client. It may also work on other servers that preserve the 1.12.1 talent API and assets, but only Turtle WoW is supported.

# Commands

All commands start with `/tc` :

- `/tc calc` — Open the calculator window.
- `/tc reset` — Reset the viewer and clear any planned talents.
- `/tc info` — Show addon information and artwork credits.


# Using the calculator

- **Add/Remove points:** Left-click to add a rank; right-click to remove the latest rank for that talent.

- **Save & Use:** Save your plan so the viewer lists which talent to take at each level.

- **Export/Import:** Copy a compact code to share builds or reload them later.


# FAQ

- **Why is the calculator only available at level 10+?**
  - Honestly?  I added the restriction for a reason I can't remember.  Let me know if you would like to be able to disable the level restriction in the settings.

- **Why aren’t any default builds included?**
  - Because I have no clue what talents other classes or builds should take, or what the best leveling builds are.  If you know a good leveling build, feel free to make a talent plan with the calculator and share it with others.

# Known limitations

- **UI skins:** UI overhaul addons can override Blizzard assets; if backgrounds look off, test on a clean UI.
